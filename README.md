# Math-136-Final-Project
For unidirectional flow problem finite difference method, the explicit and implicit formulations are used, as described in the section 8.2.1-8.2.4. The problem formulation is described in section 8.2.1 by formula (8.2.1). For flow in a cavity problem, the steady flow case is implemented, described in section 8.5.4; the problem formulation can be found in the same section by formula (8.5.19).
